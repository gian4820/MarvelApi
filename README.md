# MarvelApi
Website using API of Marvel

This is my project using the API of Marvel.
First of all, when you open the index.html, yoy will see all the super hero's of Marvel. 
They are displayed 100 characters per page. And there are 14 pages available.
You can select your favourites characters, by clicking in the button "Save Super Heros".
If you have selected any favourite char, you need to save it, before you move to another page. 
And you can search for any Super Hero, listed on the page!
