# MarvelApi
Website using API of Marvel

This is my project using the API of Marvel.
  *First of all, when you open the index.html, you will see all the super hero's of Marvel. 
  *They are displayed by 100 characters per page. And there are 14 pages,that list all the characters.
  *You can select your favourites characters, by clicking in the checkbox hearth".
  *If you have selected any favourite char, you need to save it, before you move to another page. 
  *If you want to search any super hero, you can do it the navbar search !
